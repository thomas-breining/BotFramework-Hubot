# Description:
#   Middleware to make Hubot work well with Microsoft Teams
#
# Configuration:
#	HUBOT_OFFICE365_TENANT_FILTER
#
# Commands:
#	None
#
# Notes:
#   1. Typing indicator support
#   2. Properly converts Slack @mentions to Teams @mentions
#   3. Properly handles chat vs. channel messages
#   4. Optionally filters out messages from outside the tenant
#   5. Properly handles image responses.
#   6. Generates adaptive cards with follow up buttons for specific commands
#   7. Optionally restricts authorization to Hubot to a defined list of users
